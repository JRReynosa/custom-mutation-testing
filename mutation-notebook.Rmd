title: "Mutation Testing"
output: html_notebook

Load project score, statement coverage, *mutation coverage*, and performance on incremental development metrics from Fall 2016. Additional variables include `solved` which is `1 if score.reftest >= 0.95 else 0`.

```{r}
mutationdata = read.csv('data/f16.csv')
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
